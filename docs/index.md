# Welcome to the Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning Book

This is the online book version of the [Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow course](https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse).

For the full code see the [course GitHub](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning).

This course will teach you foundations of deep learning and TensorFlow as well as prepare you to pass the TensorFlow Developer Certification exam (optional).

Before signing up to the full course, you can watch the first 14-hours of videos on YouTube in a two part series:

 - [Part 1](https://youtu.be/tpCFfeUEGs8) contains notebooks 00, 01 and some of 02 (see below)
 - [Part 2](https://youtu.be/ZUKz4125WNI) starts where part 1 left off and finishes the rest of 02

Videos going through the rest of the notebooks (03 - 10) are available in [the full course](https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse).
