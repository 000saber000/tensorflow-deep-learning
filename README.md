**NOTE:** this readme is a work in progress & will be updated as more materials are built... maybe we'll livestream some of the final stretch of development

the repo may look rough at the moment.. but give her a month or so (maybe a little longer, because a month is Christmas) and she'll be a work of art! - Daniel Bourke, 26 Nov 2020

# Status (2 Dec 2020):

* Currently polishing/preparing slides for notebook 02, once 00, 01, 02 are done, I'll record videos for them
* Created GitHub Project Page! See a cool Kanban setup here: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/projects/1
* Finished slides for notebooks: 00, 01
* Polished (prepared them for external use) notebooks: 00, 01
* Finished 09/10 of code notebooks (time series still to come)

## Next/TODO:
geez... I forgot how much there was still to go... classic project planning

* Make a GitHub Project for course (see "Projects" tab) âœ…
* Make a [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/3874) for course (thank you [Alvaro](https://github.com/alvarobartt))
* What are the prerequisites for this bad body? 
  * 6 months Python plus familiarity with data analysis libraries like NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, Scikit-Learn
  * Any beginner machine learning course, [this one](https://dbourke.link/ZTMMLcourse) is pretty good though
* Make slides for lectures
* Make videos of notebooks/code/concepts
* Make Colab overview video (Colab is the tool we'll be using for the whole course)
* Upload solutions for exercises (probably livestream the creation of these)
* Polish GitHub readme (what you're reading now) with extra resources:
  * data links used in course
  * extra resources & curriculum
  * what will someone leave with after going through this course?
  
**Log**
* 02 Dec 2020 - notebook 02 95% done, slides for 02 90% done
* 01 Dec 2020 - added notebook 02 (90% polished), start preparing slides for 02
* 27 Nov 2020 - polished notebook 01, made slides for notebook 01
* 26 Nov 2020 - polished notebook 00, made slides for notebook 00

# Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow (coming soon, stay tuned for updates) 
All of the course materials for the [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.

## TODO - Course structure

This course is code first. The goal is to get you writing deep learning code as soon as possible.

It is taught with the following mantra:

```
Code -> Concept -> Code -> Concept -> Code -> Concept...
```

This means we write code first then step through the concepts behind it.

If you've got 6-months experience writing Python code, you'll be able to do the course.

TODO: tailor this to DL course
1. Create a framework for working through problems (6 step machine learning modelling framework)
2. Find tools to fit the framework
3. Targeted practice = use tools and framework steps to work on end-to-end machine learning modelling projects

TODO: outcomes of the course (e.g. how does it benefit a student?... don't worry about the features, benefits are more important...)

## Course materials

TODO: add course materials

* 00 - TensorFlow Basics

### Data

TODO: add links to data
* some of (most of) the data for the course is too big to host on GitHub, going to use Dropbox/Kaggle etc (Google Storage too expensive for transfer times)

### Slides

TODO: add links/slides for each different section

## Exercises

TODO: link to exercises

## Extra Resources & Curriculum

To prevent the course from being 100+ hours (deep learning is a broad field), various external resources for different sections are recommended to puruse under your own discrestion.

TODO: link external resources & curriculum
