# Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow
All of the course materials for the Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.

## TODO - Course structure

This course is code first. The goal is to get you writing deep learning code as soon as possible.

It is taught with the following mantra:

```
Code -> Concept -> Code -> Concept -> Code -> Concept...
```

This means we write code first then step through the concepts behind it.

If you've got 6-months experience writing Python code, you'll be able to do the course.

TODO: outcomes of the course (e.g. how does it benefit a student?... don't worry about the features, benefits are more important...)

## Extra Resources & Curriculum

To prevent the course from being 100+ hours (deep learning is a broad field), various external resources for different sections are recommended to puruse under your own discrestion.
